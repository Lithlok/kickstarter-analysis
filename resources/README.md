# Kickstarting with Excel

Purpose
The project for this week's challenge is a data set provided for an in depth breakdown of various Kickstarter 
funding projects and learning how to both analyze and display the data in a user friendly format.
The purpose of this week's challenge is familiarization of Excel and associated Pivot Chart and Graph capabilities.


Analysis and Challenges
While looking at the data, I noticed that through the filtering out of all subcategories except 'plays',
then that dataset provided no values. While this was great to learn and I struggled with how to program in the ranges
for goals, including this set at a 0 value seems like I've done this process incorrectly, even thought I've reread the 
instructions carefully.

	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Through the attached Pivot Chart, it can be concluded that the most successful kickstarter projects based on the launch date 
fall within the summer months. Adversely, the least successful projects are in the winter. While this is true, it can also 
be concluded that the line graph looks very promising, while not taking into account that the amount of total projects was also 
higher in the summer and lower in the winter.

	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Within the attached Pivot Chart, it is concluded that most of the projects fall on the low end of the cost spectrum,
and the percentage successful is also higher in these brackets. The anomaly is within the 35000 to 45000 range, where 
cost does not relate to success as seen in the rest of the chart. As a general analysis, the lower the cost of the project, 
the higher the probablitity of success.

Some limitations to this data is the cancelled data range when the filters are applied. It is not helpful from a presentation 
standpoint, and could be distracting without the explanation of no values in the 'plays' subcategory.


Results
I would suggest backing projects in the late spring/ early summer based on the Outcomes based on Launch Date data. I would also conclude 
that the probability of a project being 'cancelled' is very low.

From  Goals perspective, i would suggest backing projects at a low cost, and also that there will be many more options to choose from 
while the cost is low.

Some limitations to the data set are that it does not provide values on how close to the goals each project was. It cannot be suggested
that a client pursues a similar type of production that 'almost' succeeded, as that data hasn't been presented to them, and referenced to the 
project that they WERE interested in.

I believe that a hiearchy chart may be useful in this scenario, so that there is a visual representation of a client's attempted 
project, a similar project that succeded or almost succeded, and a cost representation.

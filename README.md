An analysis of Kickstarter campaigns as a whole as well as an in depth look at both United states and Great Britian trends based on your needs.
By viewing the data as a whole, it can be seen that theater in the US and Music in GB are defiently the most successful campaigns. I recommend launching in the late spring, as the data suggests that is the most successful launch window.

I am attaching some files to show you what I'm referring to. Have a great launch!
